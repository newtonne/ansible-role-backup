Ansible Role: Backup
====================

[![CI](https://github.com/newtonne/ansible-role-backup/workflows/CI/badge.svg?event=push)](https://github.com/newtonne/ansible-role-backup/actions?query=workflow%3ACI)

Installs [borgmatic](https://github.com/witten/borgmatic) and [borg](https://www.borgbackup.org), and configures the automated backup of files, as well as MySQL and PostgreSQL databases.

Requirements
------------

Optional requirements:

* `cron` must be installed in order to automate the backups.

* MySQL or a MySQL-compatible database must be installed in order to backup MySQL databases. Similarly for PostgreSQL databases.

Role Variables
--------------

Available variables are listed below, along with default values (see defaults/main.yml):

### Borgmatic config-related

```
backup_directories: []
```
The list of directories (or individual files) to backup.

```
backup_databases: []
#- name: my_mysql_database
#  type: mysql
#  user: backup_user
#  pass: secret
#- name: my_postgresql_database
#  type: postgresql
#  user: backup_user
#  host: hostname
#  port: 5433
```
The list of databases to backup. `type` can be mysql or postgresql. The available options for each are listed above. `name`, `type` and `user` are required.

```
backup_repositories: []
```
The list of `borg` repositories to backup to. These must be created in advance using [`borg init`](https://borgbackup.readthedocs.io/en/stable/usage/init.html). Also see [borg documentation on repository URLs](https://borgbackup.readthedocs.io/en/stable/man_intro.html?highlight=ssh%3A%2F%2F#repository-urls).

```
backup_location_options: {}
backup_storage_options: {}
backup_retention_options: {}
backup_consistency_options: {}
backup_hooks_options:
  before_backup:
    - "{{ backup_hooks_directory }}/before.sh"
  after_backup:
    - "{{ backup_hooks_directory }}/after.sh"
  on_error:
    - "{{ backup_hooks_directory }}/error.sh"
```
These variables can be used to supply extra configuration to `borgmatic`, such as the encryption passphrase for the `borg` repo or additional/alternative hook scripts/commands. See the [borgmatic schema](https://projects.torsion.org/witten/borgmatic/src/branch/master/borgmatic/config/schema.yaml) for the complete list of config options.

```
backup_hooks_globlist: hooks/*
```

```
backup_hooks_directory: /etc/borgmatic/hooks
```
The directory to which any `borgmatic` hook scripts found by the above glob patterns will be copied.

backup_cron_path: "{{ backup_borg_path | dirname }}:/usr/bin:/bin"
```
The value of `$PATH` to set at the top of the crontab.
